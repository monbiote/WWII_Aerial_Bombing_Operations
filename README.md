# WWII Aerial Bombing Operations Analysis

## Introduction

This repository hosts an in-depth R analysis of World War II aerial bombing operations. The project is aimed at uncovering patterns, strategies, and impacts of these operations through data-driven insights.

Lt Col Jenns Robertson of the US Air Force developed the Theater History of Operations Reports (THOR) and posted them online after receiving Department of Defense approval.

## Project Structure

- `WWII_Bombing_Operations.ipynb`: The primary Jupyter Notebook with the analysis.
- `operations.csv`: Dataset detailing the WWII aerial bombing operations.

## Technologies and Techniques

This project extensively uses R for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization:

- **Data Import and Preparation**: Utilizing `read.csv` for importing and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Data Manipulation**: Employing data aggregation and accuracy checks, potentially involving `dplyr` or base R functions.
- **R Plotting with ggplot2**: Crafting comprehensive visualizations of operations data, highlighting trends and insights.
- **Advanced Plot Formatting**: Using the `scales` package for sophisticated axis scaling and formatting.

## Data Description

The dataset, `operations.csv`, includes comprehensive data on dates, locations, aircraft types, and mission outcomes from WWII aerial bombing operations.

## Strategic Insights

- WWII aerial bombing was most intense in the European and Pacific Theaters, moderately active in the Mediterranean, with minimal operations in secondary theaters like China, Burma & India
- The European, Pacific and Mediterranean theatres were the theatres with the highest number of bombing operations.
- The timeline of WWII aerial bombing missions reveals a gradual increase from the war's start, peaking in mid-1944 due to strategic intensification by the Allies, followed by a decline and a final surge in early 1945 before ceasing after the war's end in September 1945.
- The monthly high explosive bombs dropped during WWII shows a marked peak in the European Theater in early 1945, highlighting a significant Allied bombing intensification, contrasted by a steady rise in the Pacific Theater peaking in mid-1945
- Lighter high explosive bombs were typically use in highest priority missions, and heavier high explosive bombs were used on lower priority targets.
- During WWII, aerial missions predominantly conducted operations with a smaller payload, with only a minority of missions involving the delivery of large numbers of bombs.
